# Halloween Discord Bot
----------------------
This Discord Bot was made for a Halloween event on Sophie's WHOLE Circus 🤹🎭🎪🌝🌚🤡 Discord Server.
Collect Candies and participate in random events to be the best Trick O' Treater around!

## Setup
To set up the bot, set up the bad JSON database by running the `dbSetup.js` file in the `parts/` folder.</br>
The setup script will also create a `.env` file at the project root which will have to contain the Discord Bot's token inside the quotes.</br>
Once this is done, run `npm install` to install the dependencies required for the project and run `npm start` to turn the bot on.

## Adjustments
Small adjustments such as changing cooldown timers or prefixes can be done in the `config.json` file inside of the `parts/` folder.</br>
All code for commands are in the `run.js` file and can be changed up there.
